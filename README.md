Locora is a **hyperlocal community platform** that connects neighbours within the same street or locality. It lets residents find local activity partners, recover lost & found items, share service visits to split costs, and stay informed through community service alerts — all without passwords, thanks to an OTP-based email sign-in.

---

## ✨ Features

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🏃 **Community Activities** | Post and discover nearby activities (walks, sports, study groups). Join, chat in real-time, and leave when done. |
| 🔍 **Lost & Found Board** | Report lost pets, keys, wallets, or found items. Interested neighbours can open a private chat to claim items. |
| 🔧 **Service Piggybacking** | Broadcast that a plumber, electrician, etc. is visiting, so neighbours can book the same slot and split the call-out fee. |
| 📢 **Service Alerts** | Community-wide announcements about water cuts, power outages, road works, and other local disruptions. |
| 👤 **User Profiles** | View your own activity history, hosted items, and public profile. Block abusive users. |
| 🔒 **Passwordless Auth** | Sign in with just an email — an OTP is sent and verified. No password to forget. |
| 💬 **Real-time Chat** | Socket.io-powered group chat per activity and per lost-found claim thread. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9
- A **MongoDB Atlas** cluster (free tier works)
- A **Cloudinary** account (free tier works)
- A **Gmail** account with an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) for OTP emails

---

### 1 · Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/locora.git
cd locora
```

### 2 · Configure the server

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `server/.env` and fill in every value:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/Locora

# CORS — must match your client dev URL
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# JWT secrets — generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
JWT_SECRET=<64-char-hex>
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<64-char-hex>

# Gmail SMTP (OTP emails)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx      # Gmail App Password
EMAIL_FROM="Locora" <noreply@locora.app>
```

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Server listens on http://localhost:5000
```

### 3 · Configure the client

```bash
cd ../client
cp .env.example .env
```

For local development you can leave `VITE_API_URL` empty — Vite's proxy forwards `/api` and `/socket.io` to the server automatically:

```env
# Leave empty for local dev
VITE_API_URL=
```

Install dependencies and start Vite:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# App opens on http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 📡 API Overview

All routes are prefixed with `/api`.

| Prefix | Description |
|---|---|
| `/api/auth` | OTP sign-in flow, token refresh, logout, `/me` |
| `/api/users` | Public profile view, block/unblock |
| `/api/activities` | CRUD, join/leave, participant list, chat messages |
| `/api/lost-found` | CRUD, claim threads, resolve |
| `/api/services` | Service piggybacking listings & interest |
| `/api/service-alerts` | Community alerts CRUD & interest tracking |
| `/api/blocks` | Block / unblock users |

Health check: `GET /health`

---

## 🔌 Socket.io Events

Real-time features use the following event contract:

| Event | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `join_activity_room` | client → server | Join a Socket.io room for an activity |
| `activity_message` | client → server | Send a chat message to an activity room |
| `new_message` | server → client | Broadcast a new chat message |
| `participant_joined` | server → client | Notify room of a new participant |
| `participant_left` | server → client | Notify room of a departure |
| `activity_status_changed` | server → client | Broadcast when organiser opens/closes an activity |
| `typing` / `stop_typing` | both | Typing indicators |
| `user_online` / `user_offline` | server → client | Presence tracking |
| `new_notification` | server → client | Push an in-app notification |

---

## 🗄️ Data Models

```
User            — profile, location (GeoJSON Point), role, reputation
Activity        — type, location, schedule, capacity, status (open/matched/closed)
ActivityParticipant — join/leave records
ActivityMessage — activity-room chat messages
LostFound       — lost/found reports with images and location
LostFoundChat   — claim thread messages
Service         — service piggybacking listings
ServiceAlert    — community disruption announcements
ServiceAlertInterest — neighbour interest in a service alert
Session         — refresh-token store
OtpRequest      — OTP code + expiry for passwordless auth
HostBlock       — user block relationships
```

All location fields use a **GeoJSON Point** with a `2dsphere` index for geospatial proximity queries (`$near`).

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

Locora is **passwordless**:

1. User enters their email on `/signin`.
2. Server generates a 6-digit OTP, hashes it, and emails it via Gmail SMTP.
3. User enters the OTP on `/signin/otp`.
4. Server verifies the OTP, issues a short-lived **JWT access token** (stored in memory) and a long-lived **refresh token** (stored in an `HttpOnly` cookie and in the `Session` collection).
5. All protected API calls include the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
6. The client silently refreshes the access token using `POST /api/auth/refresh`.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

| Service | Platform |
|---|---|
| Frontend | [Vercel](https://vercel.com) — auto-deploy from `/client` |
| Backend | [Render](https://render.com) or [Railway](https://railway.app) — from `/server` |
| Database | [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas) |
| Media | [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) |

### Production environment variables (server)

Set all variables from `server/.env.example` in your hosting dashboard. Key additions for production:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
CLIENT_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
```

### Vercel client config

Set in the Vercel project settings:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-render-api.onrender.com
```

The `client/vercel.json` already includes a rewrite rule to support client-side routing:

```json
{ "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }] }
```

## 📁 Key Scripts

### Server
| Script | Command |
|---|---|
| Development | `npm run dev` |
| Production build | `npm run build` |
| Start compiled build | `npm start` |
| Type-check | `npm run lint` |

### Client
| Script | Command |
|---|---|
| Development | `npm run dev` |
| Production build | `npm run build` |
| Preview production build | `npm run preview` |
| Type-check | `npm run lint` |

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Reputation & badge system (Newcomer → Local Legend)
- [ ] Web Push notifications (PWA / service worker)
- [ ] Global search across activities, lost-found, and services
- [ ] Admin moderation panel
- [ ] Business directory & reviews module
- [ ] Neighbourhood groups / society code system

---

## 🚫 Non-Goals (v1)

- **No AI/ML** — matching and proximity is purely distance + time + rule-based
- **No Redis** — activity status is a simple enum field toggled by the organiser
- **No payments** — service sharing is coordinated manually between neighbours
- **No image-similarity search** for Lost & Found — category + text filters only
